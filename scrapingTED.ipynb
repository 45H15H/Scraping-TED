      "[\"What if our efforts\\nto build a better planet benefited half of this room more? What if we reduced our emissions but increased the gap\\nbetween men and women? What if by 2050 we reach net zero, but women had a lower chance\\nthan men to find a decent job? Disturbing, right? And yet, this is exactly\\nwhat my colleagues and I found while studying the links\\nbetween women and climate over the last years. Our research has shown\\nthat climate action, as it is unfolding, could set gender equality\\nback by 15 years. I'm going to say that again. So climate action, not climate change, climate action, meaning all the efforts\\nthat are being made to reduce our emissions, to adapt our lives to a warmer planet, could actually set gender equality\\nback by 15 years. \", 'I know what you must be thinking. This is a total buzzkill. ', '(Laughter) ', \"So the climate challenge\\nis not big enough, youâ€™re adding solving gender\\nequality to the equation? I get the feeling. But the good news is, if we do it right, we have a unique chance to advance\\nboth the climate agenda and gender equality. How? By being intentional about it. But first, let's go back to that 15-year\\nsetback risk I mentioned. I give it to you, it's counterintuitive\\nto say that climate action that aims at building\\na more viable future to all of us could actually have a negative impact\\non gender equality. \", \"So let me explain. Obviously women, as well as men, women even more than men, will benefit from living\\nin a more sustainable planet. Their health, their education,\\ntheir livelihoods will improve. But what I'm saying\\nis that there is also a risk that women might miss out on the green economy's massive investments and job opportunities. \", 'And here are two examples of that. By 2030, 65 million green jobs will be created. The highest-paid, more stable ones\\nwill require whatâ€™s called STEM education: science, technology,\\nengineering and mathematics. Today, women represent 35 percent\\nof STEM students globally. So they might be less qualified\\nto access these green jobs. ', 'Second example: by 2030, companies\\nin highly emitting sectors -- such as energy, building materials,\\nindustrial goods -- will be spending as much\\nas 500 billion dollars to train their employees\\nin new green skills. ', \"Now, these industries\\nare historically male-dominated, so mechanically, women are less likely\\nto participate in these retrainings, widening the skill gap\\nbetween men and women again in accessing the jobs of the future. So, see, the risk is real. Women might miss out\\non these opportunities and investments, or at least miss out on part of them, even if this wasn't the initial intent. \", 'So what is it that we need to do to have a climate action that solves these two\\nmajor challenges at the same time: gender equality and sustainability? Well, we need to do something\\nthat seems very simple, yet very often overlooked. When investing in green projects and developing green products,\\ncrafting green legislations, we need to make sure that women\\nas well as men will equally benefit. Not more, not less. Just equally. ', 'Might seem obvious. You might even think,\\n\"Isn\\'t that what we\\'re already doing?\" But history has showed us\\nthat time and time again, even though this is\\nwhat we think we\\'re doing, this is not what is actually happening, at least not naturally, organically, not without an explicit intent. So we need to take this intent\\ninto climate action. We need to naturally, systematically, intentionally embed\\nwhat you could call a gender lens in all of the green economyâ€™s\\ninvestments, projects and legislations. ', 'And I am not just talking\\nabout projects targeting women or funds dedicated to women or a gender day in climate negotiations. I am talking about gender\\nas an intentional forethought in every green project,\\nevery green investment, every green legislation. ', \"Let's take an example. Green cities. Green cities are a great illustration of how we could integrate this gender lens and have climate action\\nboost gender equality instead of setting it back. From Chicago to Shanghai, from Copenhagen to Rio, most large cities have ambitious\\nprograms to become greener. Two trillion dollars\\nwill have to be spent every year for the next 20 years to upgrade urban infrastructure and make it more sustainable. And this covers housing, energy safety, public transportation,\\ngreen spaces, you name it. With the right approach, these cities can become greener and more inclusive of women. \", 'Now greener, they sort of know\\nhow to do that. They have already initiated\\nmultiple projects, and there is already a lot\\nof research in that field. ', \"But becoming more inclusive of women, we hear less about that. This is less documented. And yet there is a great story\\nthat can serve as an inspiration. This story takes place\\nin the beautiful city of Vienna, in Austria. In the '90s, planning officials in Vienna realized that women were less satisfied\\nwith transportation systems than men. Because these systems are designed\\nfor people going between home and work, between suburbs and city centers at mostly set times. But women, although they make up the majority\\nof public transportation users, women's trips are nothing like that. They are much more fragmented,\\nthey are much shorter, they require multiple\\ntransportation modes, and they don't necessarily happen\\nduring rush hour. All of this because women\\ncombine their work trips with their domestic\\nand caregiving responsibilities. And this, transportation, is a major\\nfactor when it comes to womenâ€™s labor and participation [in] the economy. They also noticed something else. Before the age of nine, boys and girls would equally go to parks. But when girls reach the age of nine,\\nsomething strange happens. They almost disappeared from public parks. So they did some research\\nand they confirmed that, no, itâ€™s not that all of a sudden,\\nwhen girls turn nine, they no longer are interested\\nin public parks. It's again, because of the way\\nthese parks are designed with their single large open space\\nand multiple football cages, boys feel welcomed, girls feel they need to compete for space. So they just stopped going there. \", \"So bottom line, through these\\ntwo examples and many more, they realized that the gender-neutral\\napproach that the city had and that most cities in the world have, this gender-neutral approach\\ncan actually be a women-blind one. So they decided to intentionally design\\na gender-equal urban planning program. So they surveyed men and women to better understand the way\\nthey live in the city. They brought in female architects\\nand urban planners to participate alongside\\ntheir male colleagues, to participate [in] the cityâ€™s redesign. They added gender assessment\\nin social housing and infrastructure contracts. So see, just like that,\\nevery step was made with the intention,\\nthe explicit intention, to make sure that women\\nwill benefit as well as men. Again, not more, not less, as well as men. So in parks they have added foot paths\\nto divide up space. They have integrated\\na wider range of activities such as volleyball. And just like that, teenage girls came back to parks. And this has benefited teenage girls,\\nbut not only them. Every year since 2009, except for COVID years, Vienna has been named\\nthe best city in the world to live in. Now, it's not just the gendered approach, but it clearly contributed\\nbecause for the first time, the specific needs of the other\\nhalf of the population were taken into account. \", \"Now, what does Vienna's story tell us? It tells us that if we want women\\nto benefit from a green city project, from an urbanism project,\\nor from any project, it needs intention. And intention means\\nat least these three ingredients: upfront and ascending\\nwomen specific needs, even if the project is not specifically\\ntargeting women; involving women in the design\\nof the project; and specifically measuring\\nthe impact of the project on women to be able to adjust if necessary. \", 'So this way, with this approach, we could correct the biases that are behind the gender-neutral\\nurban planning programs that exist everywhere. And we could duplicate Viennaâ€™s\\nintentional experience in every green city. ', 'And I left the best part for the end. When involved in urban planning, women proved to be active agents\\nof sustainability. Statistically, the most sustainable cities are also the ones with the highest\\nrepresentation of women in policy making and leadership positions. So this gendered approach will not only\\nmake green cities more inclusive of women, it will also make them greener. Treating women exactly like men, as I have heard multiple times\\nfrom policymakers and leaders, is not what will get us to gender equality because it turns a blind eye\\nto the biases that we all have, and it tends to perpetuate\\npre-existing inequalities and could even be widening them. Urbanism is just one example of how the green economy\\nwill revolutionize the way we move, work, eat. If we intentionally embed a gender lens\\nin the way we will sustainably rebuild, rethink all of these aspects, we can advance gender equality\\nat the same time, and this will in turn have\\na positive impact on the planet. See, we can save the world\\nall at once, after all. ', 'Thank you. ', '(Applause) ']\n"

      "What if our efforts\n",
      "to build a better planet benefited half of this room more? What if we reduced our emissions but increased the gap\n",
      "between men and women? What if by 2050 we reach net zero, but women had a lower chance\n",
      "than men to find a decent job? Disturbing, right? And yet, this is exactly\n",
      "what my colleagues and I found while studying the links\n",
      "between women and climate over the last years. Our research has shown\n",
      "that climate action, as it is unfolding, could set gender equality\n",
      "back by 15 years. I'm going to say that again. So climate action, not climate change, climate action, meaning all the efforts\n",
      "that are being made to reduce our emissions, to adapt our lives to a warmer planet, could actually set gender equality\n",
      "back by 15 years.  I know what you must be thinking. This is a total buzzkill.  (Laughter)  So the climate challenge\n",
      "is not big enough, youâ€™re adding solving gender\n",
      "equality to the equation? I get the feeling. But the good news is, if we do it right, we have a unique chance to advance\n",
      "both the climate agenda and gender equality. How? By being intentional about it. But first, let's go back to that 15-year\n",
      "setback risk I mentioned. I give it to you, it's counterintuitive\n",
      "to say that climate action that aims at building\n",
      "a more viable future to all of us could actually have a negative impact\n",
      "on gender equality.  So let me explain. Obviously women, as well as men, women even more than men, will benefit from living\n",
      "in a more sustainable planet. Their health, their education,\n",
      "their livelihoods will improve. But what I'm saying\n",
      "is that there is also a risk that women might miss out on the green economy's massive investments and job opportunities.  And here are two examples of that. By 2030, 65 million green jobs will be created. The highest-paid, more stable ones\n",
      "will require whatâ€™s called STEM education: science, technology,\n",
      "engineering and mathematics. Today, women represent 35 percent\n",
      "of STEM students globally. So they might be less qualified\n",
      "to access these green jobs.  Second example: by 2030, companies\n",
      "in highly emitting sectors -- such as energy, building materials,\n",
      "industrial goods -- will be spending as much\n",
      "as 500 billion dollars to train their employees\n",
      "in new green skills.  Now, these industries\n",
      "are historically male-dominated, so mechanically, women are less likely\n",
      "to participate in these retrainings, widening the skill gap\n",
      "between men and women again in accessing the jobs of the future. So, see, the risk is real. Women might miss out\n",
      "on these opportunities and investments, or at least miss out on part of them, even if this wasn't the initial intent.  So what is it that we need to do to have a climate action that solves these two\n",
      "major challenges at the same time: gender equality and sustainability? Well, we need to do something\n",
      "that seems very simple, yet very often overlooked. When investing in green projects and developing green products,\n",
      "crafting green legislations, we need to make sure that women\n",
      "as well as men will equally benefit. Not more, not less. Just equally.  Might seem obvious. You might even think,\n",
      "\"Isn't that what we're already doing?\" But history has showed us\n",
